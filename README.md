# Web_Scraping_Mars

### Main Objective
A client, Robin, needs help on a web-scraping and data analysis project for a mission to Mars. The project consists of identifying HTML elements on a page, identifying their id and class attributes, and extracting information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. It also involves scraping HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
